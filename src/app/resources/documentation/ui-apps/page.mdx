# User interface (UI) based applications

Many applications want to give their users control over how to enrich data. pipe0 is built 
to support UIs of any complexity. This can be workflow builders, forms, or rich tables.

Our <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>-based data model is flexible.

We're currently working on providing you with some practical examples.

For now, you can draw inspiration from <AppLink linkType="externalClayExample">this example</AppLink> 
where we're trying to reimplement Clay's core logic in less than 1000 lines of code.
