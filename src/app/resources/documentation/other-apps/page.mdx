Many data enrichment problems require a solution based on a user interface. But just as many do not. Here are some examples:

🙆🏼‍♂️ Use lead scoring to classify users signing up to a product/conference/info product <br />
📈 Automatically enrich new records added to your CRM <br />
🤖 Add users matching your ICP to a marketing audience <br />

pipe0's <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>-based approach makes building programmatic enrichment flows 
easy.

We're currently working on creating practical examples.
