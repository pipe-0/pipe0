## Typescript

Pipe0 offers a <AppLink linkType="externalSDKNpm">browser SDK</AppLink> written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The SDK does not rely on Browser APIs and can be used in any Javascript-based app and runtime like node, bun, or workerd.

We're currently working on providing documentation for the SDK. 

### Use cases

Here are some things you can do with the SDK

- Have autocomplete when working with pipes and their input fields (Typescript)
- Validate <AppLink linkType="pipelineRequest">pipeline requests</AppLink> before sending them to the server
- Send pipeline requests to your proxy server (do not store the API key in the browser!)
