# Quickstart

Before making your first request, the following is required:

ðŸ‘¾ Create an account <br />
ðŸ”‘ Go to "settings" â†’ "api keys" and "create" a key <br />
ðŸ’³ Buy a subscription to make requests in production mode <br />

## Enriching data

Pipe0 is build one idea: You define enrichment <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipelines</AppLink> and run them. Using a single operation, you can power any kind 
of enrichment at any granularity - including rich tables where rows or cells and enriched in isolation.

The following request enriches one <AppLink linkType="inputObject">input object</AppLink> by adding a company description
and an email field.

    <div>
```typescript
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
},
body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [
    {
        pipeId: "PeopleGetWorkEmailWaterfall@1"
    },
    ],
    input: [
        {
            id: 1, // assign an id to each input object
            name: "John Doe",
            companyWebsiteURL: "https://pipe0.com"
        }
    ]
})
});

            },

        "input": [
            {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "companyWebsiteURL": "https://pipe0.com"
            }
        ]
    }'
```
    </div>

### Inputs & outputs

Every pipe takes one or more input fields and produces one or more output fields. Pipe inputs 
can be provided by the input objects or another pipe in the pipeline. Before any pipeline 
starts processing we validate it as a whole and check if the inputs and output align.

Incomplete data is accepted but at least one of your input objects must have the input for a given pipe.

Input and output fields have default names. You can reassign fields to different names by passing a <AppLink linkType="pipe">config object</AppLink>.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Internally, we analyze your <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>
> and determine the best order of execution. Learn more about how to pass configuration to pipes <AppLink linkType="pipe">here</AppLink>.

## Sync or Async Processing

You can choose between <AppLink linkType="syncProcessing">synchonous processing</AppLink> 
(wait for the enrichment to complete) and <AppLink linkType="asyncProcessing">asynchonous processing</AppLink> (polling).

## Pipeline response

Enrichment requests (sync + async) return <AppLink linkType="pipelineResponse">pipeline response</AppLink> objects.

## Sandbox

Running pipelines in production incurs usage costs. This is why all pipes offer a 
<AppLink linkType="testMode">sandbox environment</AppLink>. **Making requests in within the sandbox environment is always free.**

Do not expect sandbox data to make sense. Expect the data to be structurally 
correct in regards to type, content length, and format.

To send `sandbox` requests, set the header `x-environment` to a value of "sandbox"`.
