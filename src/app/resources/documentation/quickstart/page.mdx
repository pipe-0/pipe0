# Quickstart

Before making your first request, the following is required:

ðŸ‘¾ Create an account <br />
ðŸ”‘ Go to settings -> api keys and create a key <br />
ðŸ’³ Buy a subscription to make requests in production mode <br />

## Pipeline request

<AppLink linkType="pipelineRequest">Pipeline request</AppLink> are how data is enriched.

The request below enriches one <AppLink linkType="inputObject">input object</AppLink> with `workEmailAddress` and 
`companyDescription` fields.

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "cURL"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const result = await fetch("https://pipe0.com/api/v1/run", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${YOUR_API_TOKEN}`,
    "X-Test-Mode": "true" // Remove this header for production requests
},
body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [
    {
        name: "PeopleBusinessEmailWaterfallV1"
    },
    {
        name: "CompanyDescriptionGoogleMapsV1"
    }
    ],
    input: [
        {
            name: "John Doe",
            companyName: "Google LLC"
        }
    ]
})
});
```
    </div>
    <div>
     ```python
import requests
import json

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}",
    "X-Test-Mode": "true"  # Remove this header for production requests
}
payload = {
    "pipes": [
        {
            "name": "PeopleBusinessEmailWaterfallV1"
        },
        {
            "name": "CompanyDescriptionGoogleMapsV1"
        }
    ],
    "input": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "companyName": "Google LLC"
        }
    ]
}
response = requests.post("https://pipe0.com/api/v1/run", headers=headers, json=payload)
```
    </div>
    <div>
    ```bash
curl -X POST "https://pipe0.com/api/v1/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
-H "X-Test-Mode: true" \
-d '{
        "pipes": [
            {
            "name": "PeopleBusinessEmailWaterfallV1"
            },
            {
            "name": "CompanyDescriptionGoogleMapsV1"
            }
        ],
        "input": [
            {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "companyName": "Google LLC"
            }
        ]
    }'
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

First, we find the work email address for `John Doe` and use the email address to infer the company domain (URL).
This URL is used to query the company description.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Internally, we analyze your <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>
> and determine the best order of execution. Learn more about how to pass configuration to pipes <AppLink linkType="pipe">here</AppLink>.

## Request validation

When you send a request, it is validated before it is processed. If validation fails the server responds 
with a [400 Bad Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/400) status code.

## Pipeline response

<AppLink linkType="pipelineRequest">Pipeline requests</AppLink> are processed asynconously. The 
<AppLink linkType="pipelineResponse">pipeline response</AppLink> contains the current processing state. 
Most importantly, it contains an `id` and a `status` property.

Poll the endpoint `https://pipe0.com/api/v1/check` until the status of the task is set to `completed`.

The response you receive for a valid pipeline request is identical in shape to responses returned from the `/check`
endpoint.

## Test Mode

Running pipelines in production incurs usage costs. This is why all pipes offer a 
<AppLink linkType="testMode">test mode</AppLink>. **Making requests in test mode is always free.**

Do not expect data returned in test mode to make sense. However, expect the data returned in test mode to be structurally 
correct in regards to type, content length, and format.

To send requests in test mode, include the `X-Test-Mode: true` header.
