## Dictionary

While building pipe0 we invest heavily in consistent naming conventions. Learning these conventions will help you master our tools much quicker.

| Term    | Definition |
| -------- | ------- |
| Pipeline  | The data model we use to enrich data. A pipeline is comprised of pipes and their order, fields added by your inputs, and logic and conditions    |
| Pipeline Request  | The request you make to the `/v1/run` endpoint and its payload. |
| Pipeline Response  | The response return from (1) the `/v1/run` endpoint (2) the `/v1/check` endpoint and (3) the SDK validation. |
| Input | A list of input objects that you send as part of the request. |
| Input Object | Input objects are plain JSON objects. `Input` consists of multiple input objects. |
| Input Property | A key-value pair inside an input object. |
| Record | Part of the server response after a pipeline request. Records contain all (normalized) fields of `inputs` along with metadata such as the processing state (`queued` | `processing` | `completed`) of the record. |
| Record Field | After processing, `Input Properties` are mapped and normalized into record fields. Record fields contain a value and meta-information about the processing state of a field. |
