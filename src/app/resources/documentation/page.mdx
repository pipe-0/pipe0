## Introduction

[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a programmatic framework for data enrichment. If you have some data about a person or 
company but want more, you can do that in an infinite number of ways with pipe0.

### When to use pipe0

If you find yourself using providers like Zoominfo, Findymail, etc, and piping data from 
one service into another - you can benefit a lot from pipe0. Moving to pipe0 will drastically 
increase your data quality while making it easy to combine existing data providers with AI and web scraping.
No more spaghetti code üçù.

Here are some things pipe0 does for you:

üîå Connect 50+ data providers <br />
üí® Make data enrichment easy and fast at any scale<br />
üí∞ Run enrichment, scraping and AI infrastructure at low cost (we take 0% margin on external providers)<br />

### Use cases

There are many applications where having a unified data enrichment API helps a lot:

ü§ñ Building sales technology applications like automated outreach, SDR, etc. <br />
üßôüèª Keep data in systems like CRMs up-to-date <br />
üß¨ Working with large datasets that need to be enriched <br />

Integrating pipe0 can save months of engineering work, simplify billing, and help you focus 
on the actual task you're trying to accomplish (data enrichment is mostly just a means to an end).

## What makes pipe0 a framework?
The term `framework` may surprise you because pipe0 is an API, dashboard, and <AppLink linkType="externalSDKNpm">SDK</AppLink>.

Pipe0 is a framework because you can not only enrich data but express logic and direction of data flow too.

The following is an example of an enrichment flow that requires logic.

```text filename="Flow that needs logic"
FIND phone number of person
IF found
    FIND find timezone of that person
IF NOT found
    FIND work email address
```

While you could implement this with code, pipe0 offers a much simpler interface.

The code below performs this flow. It is robust enough to enrich thousands of records in parallel and power 
any kind of application.

```typescript
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
    "authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
},
body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [
    {
        pipeId: "PeopleGetMobileNumberWaterfall@1",
    },
    {
        pipeId: "PeopleGetTimezonePipe0@1",
        conditions: [
          {
            action: "run",
            condition: { ref: "mobilePhoneNumber", operator: "isResolved", equals: true }
          }
        ]
    },
    {
        pipeId: "PeopleGetWorkEmailHunter@1",
        conditions: [
          {
            action: "run",
            condition: { ref: "mobilePhoneNumber", operator: "isResolved", equals: false }
          }
        ]
    }
    ],
    input: [
        {
            id: 1, // assign an id to each input object
            name: "John Doe",
            companyWebsiteUrl: "https://pipe0.com"
        }
    ]
})
});
```
