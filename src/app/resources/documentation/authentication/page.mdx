## Making authenticated requests

To make authenticated requests send your API key as part of the [`Authorization` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#the_general_http_authentication_framework).

```bash filename="Authenticated request"
curl -X POST "https://pipe0.com/api/v1/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" # API_KEY in "Authorization" header
```
