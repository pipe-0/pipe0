## Introduction

> pipe0 pipe0 is a unified enrichment API for people and company data. You can leanr more about pipe0 by [visiting our landing page](/)

With pipe0 it becomes easy to add any kind of enrichment flows into your application. Weather you're planning to enrich just a couple of records 
or millions, pipe0 is designed for you.

Out goal is to build an API that is infinitely powerful but can be understood and implemented in just a couple of minutes. Check out our example of [building Clay.com](https://google.com) in less than 1k lines of code.

Our API has only two endpoints: `/v1/run` (create a task to enrich data) and `/v1/check`. Check the status of your enrichment task.

Enriching data works by fist defining a pipeline and adding `pipes` to said pipeline.

### Pipe Naming Convention

Our data enrichment catalog uses a consistent naming schema to make it easy to understand what each enrichment does, how it works, and how it’s versioned. Every enrichment name follows this format:

```
{Category}{Action}{Target}{Provider}[:{InputType}]@{Version}
```

Here’s what each part means:

#### Components
1. **Category**  
   - **What it is**: The broad group or scope this enrichment applies to.

2. **Action[Target]**  
   - **What it is**: A fused term combining the *action* (what the enrichment does) and the *target* (what it works on or produces).

3. **Provider**  
   - **What it is**: The tool, service, or approach powering the enrichment.

4. **InputType (optional)**  
   - **What it is**: Optional property listing the main input. This is used when there is a name conflict between two pipes from the same category with the same action and target.

5. **Version**  
   - **What it is**: The version number of the enrichment, showing updates or iterations.

#### Naming target

When looking for a specific pipe you may ask yourself if a pipe will be found in the  'people' or 'company' category. While this is clear for 
most pipes it gets trickier for others. Let's take the pipe `PeopleGetCompanyWebsitePipe0@1`. The pipe uses the email address input of a **person** 
to generate a the website URL of a **company**.

In cases like these you can assume that the input of the pipe conveys intent. The pipes inputs (email address) are people data. We assume users
are using the pipe to enrich people data since a person is the subject of the action.

In short, the pipe category is determined by its inputs.


This naming convention ensures our enrichment catalog is intuitive, consistent, and powerful—making it simple for you to find and use the right tool for your data needs.
