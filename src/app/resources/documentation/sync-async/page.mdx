# Sync or Async

You can choose between synchonous and asynchonous processing when enriching data.

## Synchonous Processing

Synchonous processing is suitable for a small number of pipes and input objects. If the processing takes too long
your request will time out.

Synchonous processing is easier than asynchonous processing since you do not have to 
deal with polling.

To make a synchonous request use the `https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync` endpoint.

```bash filename="sync-request.sh"
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '{
        "pipes": [
            {
            "pipeId": "PeopleGetWorkEmailWaterfall@1"
            },
        ],
        "input": [
            {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "companyWebsiteURL": "https://pipe0.com"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

## Asynchonous Processing

Use asynchonous processing when you want to enrich larger datasets.

To process async, create a task by sending a `POST` request to the `https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run` 
endpoint.

```bash filename="async-request.sh"
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '{
        "pipes": [
            {
            "pipeId": "PeopleGetWorkEmailWaterfall@1"
            },
        ],
        "input": [
            {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "companyWebsiteURL": "https://pipe0.com"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

The response contains an `id` property. Use the `id` (taskId) to make a `GET` request to the 
`https://api.pipe0.com/v1/check/:taskId` endpoint. Both endpoint return a <AppLink linkType="pipelineResponse">Pipeline Response</AppLink>.

```bash filename="check.sh"
curl -X GET "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/check/$TASK_ID" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
