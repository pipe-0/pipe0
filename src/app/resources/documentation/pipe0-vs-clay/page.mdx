# Clay or pipe0 for Data Enrichment?

A frequent question we hear is when to use [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) and when to use [clay](https://clay.com). At first glance, it may 
seem like pipe0 is a competing product to [clay's fantastic visual enrichment tool](https://clay.com). We're not.

Clay's mission is to unlock the creativity of revenue teams. It is a **graphical** tool that you can use in graphical
ways to prospect leads and enrich lists. Clay is loved ‚ù§Ô∏è by the broader sales and RevOps community.

Many of our enrichments and methodologies are heavily inspired by clay's work. Clay introduced a 
paradigm shift to the data enrichment ecosystem and is a leader in its category.

## Pipe0 enriches data programmatically

In contrast, [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a purely programmatic tool. We're building an enrichment framework 
that you can use through our API, dashboard, and SDK. Pipe0 is the right tool for you if you:

üìä Want to power your sales technology application with enriched data <br />
üåà Want to build an application similar to clay <br />
ü§ñ Want to do advanced marketing automation with enriched data <br />
‚öôÔ∏è Are looking for programmatic use cases that don't require a user interface <br />
üéõÔ∏è Need granular control over your enrichments <br />
üí∞ Need granular control over your cost <br />

You can think of pipe0 as a technical wholesaler whereas clay is a consumer product. Integrating pipe0 requires 
effort from your side but offers benefits only possible with a programmatic provider.

## When to use clay

Clay is a graphical tool. Use clay if you are looking to enrich leads or company data through a user interface.

## Is pipe0 just the missing API to clay?

No, pipe0 is much more than just the missing API to clay. We found a new approach to data enrichment that 
we believe to be faster, more resilient, cheaper, and simpler than any tool out there (including clay).

We power data enrichment through a unique data model called <AppLink linkType="pipeline">Pipeline</AppLink>.
You can build even the most complex data enrichments with just one operation - using just one API endpoint.

Our mode of processing is fundamentally different than that of other providers. We focus our efforts on 
making it easy to integrate data enrichment into your application so you can build features on top of enriched data
extremely fast.
