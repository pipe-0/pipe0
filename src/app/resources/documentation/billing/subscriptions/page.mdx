# Subscriptions

## Manage subscriptions

All pipe0 subscriptions are securely **managed through [Stripe](https://stripe.com)**, our trusted payment processor. 
This ensures a reliable and secure environment for all your billing information.

Managing your pipe0 subscription is flexible and straightforward. You have the ability to **create, update, 
and cancel your subscription at any time** to suit your needs. Navigate to "Dashboard" > "Billing" > "Manage Subscriptions"
to access the billing portal.

### Proration of billing periods

When you **update** your subscription, any changes 
are **[prorated](https://stripe.com/en-de/resources/more/prorated-billing-101-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-use-it)**.
This means you'll only pay for the portion of the billing cycle that your new subscription tier was active, ensuring fair billing.

### Credit rollover

For your convenience, it's possible to **hold up to 3x the credit amount** of either your monthly or yearly 
subscription value. This provides a buffer for your usage, especially during periods of higher demand.

### Support

Should you encounter any issues or have questions regarding your subscription, please do not hesitate to contact 
our support team at **`support@pipe0.com`**. We're here to help!
