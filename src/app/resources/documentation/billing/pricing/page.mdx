# Pricing

At pipe0, our pricing is credit-based, offering you flexibility in how you use our services.

## Credits

As part of your subscription, you **purchase credits** which are held in your account. 
These credits are then used to enrich data with <AppLink linkType="pipe">pipes</AppLink>, making your data more valuable and actionable.

---

## Pipe Costs

Each pipe has a **predefined credit amount it charges per record** processed.
You can easily find these specific costs listed in the <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink>.

---

## Credential Management

Pipe0 offers two flexible options for managing credentials when using our pipes:

### Managed Credentials

With **managed credentials**, we handle all the underlying service authentications for you. This means you can use a pipe with your pipe0 credits as described, and you'll receive a **single bill from us**. You only need to worry about one credit balance, simplifying your accounting and usage tracking.

### Bring Your Own Credentials

Most pipes also give you the option to **bring your own credentials**. This typically involves providing your `API_KEY`s for services like OpenAI or similar providers. This approach allows you to **utilize credits you may already have with other providers** while still leveraging the powerful advantages of the pipe0 platform. If you choose this option, **you are not billed by us** for the external service's usage.
