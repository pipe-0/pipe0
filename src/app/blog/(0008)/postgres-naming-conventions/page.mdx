# PostgreSQL Naming Conventions for Intermediate Users

![image](/media/blog/20250408-2.jpg)

When designing database schemas adhering to naming conventions has pactial benefits. It contributes 
to schema clarity, query efficiency, and better collaboration.

Also, you don't look like you don't know what you are doing üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

In this post, I will introduce you to basic naming conventions when using PostgreSQL.

### Avoid uppercase letters

PostgreSQL converts unquoted identifiers to lowercase by default. Queries like: `SELECT * from UserPermissions`
are converted to `SELECT * from userpermissions`. If your table name is "UserPermissions" you have to add quotes 
to your query `SELECT * FROM "UserPermissions";`. This is tedious in practice. Stick to lowercase letters for 
everything to avoid this. Use "user_permissions" instead of "UserPermissions". 

### Stick to snake_case

Name tables, columns, and other objects using the snake_case format. The underscore helps with readability
in complex schemas and multi-word names. Snake case is a wildly accepted standard in PostgreSQL communities
and will make your schema intuitive to use.

### Use plural form for table names

Tables that store collections of entities (e.g. a list of users) should be named in the plural form. Instead, 
of naming your user table `user` use the plural form `users`. This naming convention matches the declarative 
structure of SQL queries: `SELECT ALL USERS FROM TABLE ...`.

### Use singular form for column names

In contrast to tables, column names should use the singular form. Use `users.email` instead of `users.emails`.

### Prefixes for table and column names

Don't use prefixes like `tbl_` or `col_` for columns and tables. These prefixes do not add information 
to your schema. The object type is already stored in PostgreSQL.

### Indexes and constraints

PostgeSQL requires you add add names to indexes and constraints. Here, you should use a prefix. Use the prefix `idx_` followed by 
the table and column e.g. `idx_users_email`. Prefixes are useful for unique constraints, too.

Consider the prefix `uniq_ (e.g. `uniq_users_email`). Adding these prefixes to indexes and constraints helps you to spot them
in the output of the `\d` command or when debugging queries with `EXPLAIN`. You should also 
consider a suffix for indexes (e.g., idx_users_email_btree) when using non-default methods like GIN or BRIN.

### Schema Prefixes for Organization

In databases with multiple schemas, prefix table names with the schema‚Äôs purpose (e.g., auth_users, billing_invoices).
This keeps related tables grouped logically and prevents name clashes in large projects. This is especially handy when working
on multi-tenant or modular systems.

### Avoid Reserved Keywords

Don‚Äôt use reserved words like `order`, `group`, or `select` as identifiers.
