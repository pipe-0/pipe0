# Clay vs Pipe0 for Data Enrichment

![image](/media/blog/20250406-1.jpg)

Data enrichment has become an important component of the sales stack. While traditional enrichment providers like
[ZoomInfo](https://zoominfo.com) and [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.com) have been around for a long time, many 
revenue teams have lately shifted to enrichment platforms like [Clay](https://clay.com).

Clay is a sales technology company founded in 2017. Clay's mission is to unlock the creativity of revenue teams.
It does so through its table-based interface. You can prospect leads and companies in Clay and enrich your lists
with third-party provider data.

Clay packs the power of programming and AI into a graphical tool.

## Pipe0: A Clay-like API for Data Enrichment

Similar to graphical data enrichment, APIs for data enrichment have also been around for a long time. Here too, 
AI has opened up many new opportunities for unique workflows. [Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a Clay-like API for data enrichment. Pipe0 
allows every company to add Clay-like data enrichment to any app in just a few lines of code.

Here are some cases where this is useful:

üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Programmatically enriching/scoring leads as they come in through signups <br />
üé® Building sales technology products like sales copilots and outreach tools <br />
üìö Programmatically assigning high-value leads to marketing audiences for retargeting <br />

Pipe0 is the fastest and most reliable solution to implement the above.
