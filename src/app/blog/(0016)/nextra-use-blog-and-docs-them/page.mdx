# How to Use the Docs and Blog Theme in the Same App with Nextra

[Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs) is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content-focused websites.
It combines features from Next.js and lets you create markdown-based static sites easily and straightforwardly.

Nextra offers two themes: [Blog theme](https://nextra.site/docs/blog-theme) and [docs theme](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme).

Just as you cannot have an app in `light` and `dark` theme at the same time, it is equally impossible to 
use both the blog theme and the docs theme at the same time.

Both themes define conflicting MDX components that overwrite each other at critical points.

Trying to use both themes at the same time will lead to conflicts with missing Context Providers and missing components.

## How to have a blog and docs in the same app with Nextra

It is still possible to have a blog and an app within the same app. Applications like the [SWR Docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/with-nextjs)
are built in this manner. The application supports both docs and a blog from the same repository. The code is [open source](https://github.com/vercel/swr-site/tree/main/pages).

Another example is the [pipe0 docs](https://github.com/pipe-0/pipe0).

## Setup your project

The best way to setup a blog and a docs page from the same app is to move the nextra `Layout` component out of the root layout 
component and have a seperate Nextra `Layout` for both your blog and docs. This way you you can load the content seperately 
but also control the final visual result indipendent of each other.

At [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) we set this up the following way:

```typescript filename="src/app/blog/layout.tsx"
import { Layout } from "nextra-theme-docs";
import { appInfo } from "@/lib/const";
import { getPageMap } from "nextra/page-map";
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

export default async function RootLayout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <Layout
      pageMap={await getPageMap("/blog")}
      sidebar={{ defaultOpen: false, toggleButton: false }}
      editLink={null}
      feedback={{ content: null }}
    >
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```typescript filename="src/app/resources/layout.tsx"
import { Layout } from "nextra-theme-docs";
import { getPageMap } from "nextra/page-map";
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

export default async function RootLayout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <Layout
      pageMap={await getPageMap("/resources")}
      editLink={null}
      feedback={{ content: null }}
    >
      {children}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

With this setup we store our content for `/resources` seperately from the blog posts 
and end up with a consistent visual experience for both blog and docs.
