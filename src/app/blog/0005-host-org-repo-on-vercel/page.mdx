# Deploy an organization repository for free on Vercel

Vercel has become a popular place to deploy all sorts of applications. One annoying limitation is the inability to deploy 
an organization repository as part of the free plan. This limitation seems a bit random since it is not based on any 
factors that drive cost for Vercel like traffic or bandwidth.

There is a simple way to get around this limitation, though. You can simply work in your organization repository and 
mirror it to a different repository that lives in your private account.

## Configuring repository mirroring with Github actions

#### 1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

- Go to your GitHub account settings
- Navigate to Developer settings > Personal access tokens
- Create a fine-grained token
- Give read and write permission for repository content
- Give access to the target repository
- Copy the generated token


#### 2. Add the Token as a Secret in Your Organization Repository

- Go to your organization repository settings
- Click on "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
- Click "New repository secret"
- Name: PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Value: Paste the token you copied
- "Add secret"

#### 3. Allow GitHub Actions in the Target Repository

- Go to the target repository
- Go to "settings" > "Actions" > "General"
- Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
- Select "Read and write permissions"


In the source repo add the following GitHub action file in `.github/workflows/mirror.yaml`:

Replace yourusername/private-repo.git with your actual private repository path

```yaml
name: Mirror Repository

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  mirror:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for all branches and tags
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      - name: Push to private mirror
        run: |
          git remote add private https://github.com/yourusername/private-repo.git
          git push private --force --all
          git push private --force --tags

```

Lastly, change to the source repository and watch it being applied to the target as well.
