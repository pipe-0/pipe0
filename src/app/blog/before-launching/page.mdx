# Introducing pipe0: A data enrichment framework for the next generation of sales technology

Hello. I'm [Florian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-martens-86b224b4/) 🌈. I've built what you 
currently see and will likely build most of what you will see on the [pipe0 website](https://pipe0.com) in the future.
I previously worked at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and did cool stuff with images and data.

Now I'm building sales software.

Wait, ~cross that~. Pipe0 is not sales software. Pipe0 is software for companies that build sales software. ~Cross that, too~. Pipe0 
is software for all companies that want to enrich people and company data through an API. Yeah, that sounds about right...

## From a failed start to endless pipes

A few months ago, I was set on starting a company with someone from [YC's cofounder platform](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching).
After some tinkering, we decided to build sales technology software.

As founders do, we scheduled calls with sellers to learn about their problems. We considered building sales co-pilots 👨🏼‍✈️, 
personalized outreach platforms 💌, or helping companies keep their CRM data clean 📈.

While we pitched ideas to sellers, we kept hearing about a tool called [clay](https://clay.com). A tool that allows revenue teams 
to enrich data and automate work in new ways. Sellers enjoy clay because it provides the power of programming as a graphical tool.

During these interviews, one thing became clear: No matter if we build a sales co-pilot, an outreach tool, or any other software:
If we don't run on world-class enriched data, we can't compete 😢.

The roadmap at this point:
1. Decide what to build (personalized messages, clean CRM data, sales copilot)
2. Solve data enrichment for our tool and don't just build a worse version of clay
3. Build our tool on top of the enriched data

## An uneven playing field

Building one thing is hard. Solving two complex problems is daunting. This realization hit hard and the story could have ended there.

What seems obvious to me now came as an unexpected thought while I was pumping iron at the local gym 🏋🏻:

The playing field for sales technology tools has shifted and the infrastructure hasn't caught up.

It has gotten harder to build the next big thing in sales without solving data enrichment first. 

Instead of building a sales tool, I turned to the infrastructure layer and went on a journey to solve data enrichment for other tool 
makers.

## The problem at hand

To solve data enrichment for sales technology tools many problems had to be addressed. We had to:

- 🔌 Connect existing data providers
- 🐛 Build AI-enabled scraping infrastructure
- 🤖 Allow users to enrich data with AI
- 💰 Be extremely cost-effective

## We're off to a good start, we think ...

Over the, we built the first version of pipe0. And we're off to a good start, we think.

## Our special sauce 🥫

What makes pipe0 special is its unique data model.
While tools like clay work on a cell-by-cell basis and require complex and granular processing, we found a 
much simpler way to solve the same problem.

When using pipe0 you build pipelines from enrichment pipes and run them. That's it. Our entire platform
runs on two ideas.

> Define pipelines, and run them.

Instead of having a large table with thousands of cells, you create a large pipeline with many pipes.

If you want to run a single cell, you create a new pipeline from a subset, run it, and merge it into the bigger pipeline.

If you want to run the first 10 rows of your table, you create a new pipeline from a subset, run it, merge it.

Our model is so simple that we have an internal challenge to reimplement clay's core logic in less than 1k lines of code 
(this includes a full UI).

What's more? Did I mention that you don't have to render your data as a table? In fact, you don't have to render your data at all.
Pipe0 is great at powering [tools without UI](https://pipe0.com/resources/documentation/other-apps), too.
