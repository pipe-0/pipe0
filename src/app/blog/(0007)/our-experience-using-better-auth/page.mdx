# Our Experience Using Better-Auth for Pipe0

![image](/media/blog/20250408-1.jpg)

Choosing an auth provider is a serious matter. Making a bad choice may compromise the security 
of your application, your data, and your user's data. Making the right choice seems unfairly complicated 
within the JavaScript ecosystem where tools are reinvented at record speed.

Historically, choosing tools maintained by large companies provides little safeguarding 
against this spinning flywheel.

When it comes to auth providers we can choose between three options:

1. Implement your own authentication logic
2. Choose a third-party auth platform like [auth0](https://auth0.com), or clerk (https://clerk.com)
3. Use an authentication library like [better-auth](https://better-auth.com) or [passport](https://passportjs.com)

At [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) we believe in owning our own user table. A vision that aligns with 
authentication libraries like [better-auth](https://better-auth.com) and [auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).

Additionally, we want to develop in a containerless fashion allowing our entire app to spin up
without the use of docker, or [docker](https://docker.com) compose.

Out authentication is currently powered by better auth. our implementation, we weren't able to 
find balanced reviews of the library that point out where better-auth shines or falls short.

In this post, we want to walk you through some of the points we found.

## The good parts

Better auth has many strengths:

### Fast set up

Integrating better-auth into your application is fast. On the backend, they have guides to walk you 
through the setup with [hono](https://hono.dev), [express](https://expressjs.com/), 
[Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/), and [Nitro](https://nitro.build/). Even if 
you are using a different backend framework, it is easy to integrate better-auth to it.

The frontend client also supports all common frameworks like [react](https://react.dev/), or [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

### Vast plugin ecosystem

Better auth comes with many plugins for various auth schemes like username-password, phone-number auth, and
magic link auth. In fact, it is the most extensive plugin ecosystem we've seen.

### Database Adapters

Better auth manages your database migrations through database adapters. For this better-auth can either 
directly connect to your database or plug into an ORM-like [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) or [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

### Support for OIDC and SSO

If you're building an app targeted at other organizations this has become a must-have feature.

## The bad parts

While integrating better-auth we also encountered many bad parts.

### Too much, too fast

Better auth is being developed fast. This might be due to the hype around the new library.
The hasty release cycle leads to bugs being shipped regularly and often. Its system architecture 
also makes better-auth prone to bugs. Each new feature has to be launched to many
different subsystems like the client, all database adapters, and the server library.

We've dealt with misnamed tables, the inability to rename tables, missing endpoints, and many more issues.
Especially new plugins suffer from this. New problems are also not addressed as quickly as you may hope.

### The API reference seems misplaced

Better auth ships its [own API reference](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/open-api) in the form of 
an OpenAPI document. The problem with this approach is that it lives completely outside of the rest of your
system. Most backend systems have API specs of their own. To make it compatible, you have to manually 
merge the OpenAPI documentation.

### Slow TypeScript Experience

Both the frontend and backend libraries depend on deeply nested generics. Adding better-auth to any app 
is sure to degrade the TypeScript performance of your app significantly. This problem has been acknowledged
by the team and is actively worked on.

### Will it grow forever

One of our main concerns with this library is its sheer size and the bugs resulting from that size.
Projects like the openapi-generator have had promising starts but kept adding plugins until they became unmaintainable.

We're worried that better-auth will suffer a similar fate.

### No information about the author

One of the most magical things about the world of software is that great software can come from 
everywhere and from everyone. However, you probably want to know who's writing the most sensitive 
code in your application. In better-auth's case, we weren't able to find much information about its creator,
[bekacru](https://github.com/Bekacru) - who seems to be an indie software developer from Ethiopia.

We love that he speaks through his work but would love to see him 
communicate more openly with the community and build trust. He is also the only 
collaborator on the npm package giving him full control over the release process.

The npm package also does not have any [provanance](https://docs.npmjs.com/viewing-package-provenance) 
information - which is not uncommon or concerning in itself.
