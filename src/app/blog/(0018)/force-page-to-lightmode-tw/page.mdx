# Force a Tailwind Page To Be Displayed in Light Mode

In [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) light and dark modes are treated as first-class citizens. Switching between them 
can conveniently be achieved by setting the class `.dark` on any element in the DOM tree. As a result, 
all of its children will be displayed in dark mode.

However, the opposite is not true. Tailwind does not support a class called `.light` out of the box.

## Why the lack of light mode is a problem

The problem arises when your application relies on client-side navigation. This is even the case when you 
use statically generated pages in frameworks like Next.js. While the entry point into your application will use 
browser navigation, every internal navigation will happen client-side.

If any page in your app attaches the `.dark` class to a global element like the `<html />` tag, it will persist, 
and there is no way to force a particular page into light mode.

## How to solve this

The only way to solve this is to remove the `.dark` class. You can do so with a small utility component.

If you are using Next.js, this utility component could look as follows:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export function ThemeSwitcher() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const htmlEl = document.querySelector("html"); // use whatever tag has the .dark class
    if (htmlEl && htmlEl.classList.contains("dark")) {
      htmlEl.classList.remove("dark");
    }
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

## Will this flicker?

A common browser problem that we want to avoid is a visual flicker. This is where our app is first rendered
in dark mode and then switches to light mode.

Since React executes hooks during hydration, this flicker is usually to fast to notice. If you see a flicker, 
there are two options to make this even faster:

1. In react, use `useLayoutEffect` to execute before pait
2. Inject the script right into the `<head />` tag of your browser

You can check the result on our homepage. We're using this exact component to switch the theme when you're
navigating from our blog (dark mode) to our [landing page](https://pipe0.com).
