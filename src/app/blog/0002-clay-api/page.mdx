# Does clay have a public API?

![image](/media/blog/20250405-1.jpg)

[Clay](https://clay.com) is a sales technology company that has risen to popularity.
Its mission is to unlock the creativity of revenue teams. Clay is often used for prospecting and data enrichment.

Its main interface is a large table-like surface where add, remove, and run users enrichments.

As of today, clay **does not** offer a public API you can integrate with.

For programmatic use, clay offers [webhooks](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/webhook-integration-guide).

You can read more about the lack of API support in [clays forum](https://community.clay.com/x/support/zxof33why6ow/how-to-access-clays-get-request-api-documentation).

## How to interact with clay programmatically

However, there are some ways to interact with [clay programmaticallyâ€‰](https://community.clay.com/x/support/lmkxpekv8cvh/where-can-i-find-the-api-documentation-for-clays-a).

1. Sending input data to [webhooks](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/webhook-integration-guide) in Clay
2. Using clay's [HTTP API integration](https://docs.clay.com/en/articles/9672489-http-api-with-clay) to pass output data to other services

## Pipe0 is the API that clay should have built

At [pipe0](https://pipe0.com), we build one API that allows anyone to add clay-like data enrichment into their apps. 
For this, we designed a simple but infinitely flexible data model called [Pipeline](/resources/documentation/pipeline).

## Why a clay-like API would be helpful

There are many reasons why a programmatic way to enrich data accross many providers is helpful:

- Build a tool similar to clay
- Enrich data before forwarding it to a CRM
- Marketing automation
- Powering tools for personalized outreach, sales copilots, next-gen CRMs, etc.

## Why clay may never have an API?

While building [pipe0](https://pipe0.com), we spend a lot of time analyzing how clay works. To power its datamodel clay performs 
complex processing on a cell-by-cell basis. Furthermore all processing is scoped to specific tables. A typical clay 
API response may look like this:

`PATCH https://api.clay.com/v3/tables/<TABLE_ID>/run`

```json
{
	"callerName": "ActionCellViewer",
	"fieldIds": [
		"f_sDdrC6WJKYwn"
	],
	"forceRun": true,
	"runRecords": {
		"recordIds": [
			"r_gKQAfAapfzbp"
		]
	}
}
```

While this mode of processing makes a lot of sense for the unique requirements of clay's user interface, it would not 
exactly be fun for any person trying to integrate with it programmatically.

To make matters worse, it is uniquely designed to power data as tables and would not be ideal for other forms of data
visualization.

## Marking things easier

At [pipe0](https://pipe0.com), we took a radically different approach to this. Instead of complexity, we designed our 
API with radical simplicity in mind. Our REST API is able to power every feature in clay using only one operation.

Pipe0 runs on one simple idea:

> Create a pipeline and run it

What's unique to our approach is that pipelines can be merged, sliced, and diced and many ways.

Working with a big table? Create a pipeline with many pipes and run it.

Want to enrich a single cell of that table? Create a pipeline for a subset, run it, and merge it.

Want to run the first 10 rows? You guessed it! Create a pipeline and run it.
