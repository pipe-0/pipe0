# Find a Work Email Address by Name and Company

In this blog post, we explore how you can validate work email addresses via an API endpoint.
For this, we use [pipe0](https://pipe0.com).

Pipe0 is a framework for data enrichment. To enrich data with pipe0 you use enrichment <AppLink linkType="pipe">pipes</AppLink>.
There are several pipes available to validate work email addresses via API. For this blog post, we're 
using the pipe [PeopleValidateEmailZeroBounce@1](https://www.pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog/people-validate-email-zerobounce/version-1).

This pipe uses [ZeroBounce](https://www.zerobounce.net/) to validate the existence of the email address to 
protect your reputation.

The cost per pipe invocation is ~1ct. per record.

## Prerequisites

üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go to [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) and create an account <br />
üîë Create an API Key

## Request object

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript", "cURL"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const id = 1;
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [{ name: "PeopleValidateEmailZeroBounce@1" }],
    input: [{id, workEmail: "<EMAIL_ADDRESS>" }]
  })
});

const response = await result.json();

// [NOT SHOWN] Poll the "/check" endpoint until the task status is "completed"
// Learn more: https://www.pipe0.com/resources/documentation/pipeline#async-processing

// Print email
console.log(response.records[id].fields["isEmailValid"].value);
```
    </div>
    <div>
```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
-d '{
    "pipes": [{ "name": "PeopleValidateEmailZeroBounce@1" }],
    "input": [{ id: 1, workEmail: "<EMAIL_ADDRESS>" }]
}'
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

## Using pipe0

In this example we used [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) instead of querying providers directly. Using pipe0 
has many advantages:

- Use 50+ enrichment providers with one subscription
- Combine multiple enrichments in one API call
- Up-to-date API documentation and best-in-class DX
- Combine data enrichment, web scraping, and AI for powerful solutions
