[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a framework for data enrichment. It replaces providers
like Zoominfo, Prospeo, or Findymail with a more flexible API.

Aside from finding information like email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn profiles
(s. [pipe catalog](https://pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog) for a full list),
you can use Pipe0 to express conditions, perform actions, and generate insights with AI.

We took a lot of inspiration from [Clay](https://clay.com). We moved many of its features
into a stateless, fast, and cost-effective API.

It's easy to underestimate the engineering challenge of building a robust data enrichment platform in-house.
Here are some things that you never have to worry about when using Pipe0:

⚡️ Enriching data in parallel with speed and accuracy  
🛑 Dealing with different provider rate limits  
🧼 Sanitizing & healing input  
🖥️ Monitoring dozens of 3rd-party API integrations  
🌊 Building custom waterfalls  
💵 Managing credit balances with different providers  
🏗️ Run enrichment, scraping and AI infrastructure at low cost  
🍝 Spaghetti code  
💾 Caching

## Use cases

🤖 Building sales technology applications like automated outreach, SDR, etc.  
🪄 AI Agents that need a flexible data source  
🧙🏻 Updating CRM or ATS data  
🧬 Enriching large datasets
