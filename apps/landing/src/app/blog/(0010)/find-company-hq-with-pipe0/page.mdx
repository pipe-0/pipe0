# Find a Company Headquarters Address via API

In this blog post, we explore how you can generate a company headquarters address via an API endpoint.
For this, we use [pipe0](https://pipe0.com).

Pipe0 is a framework for data enrichment. To enrich data with pipe0 you use enrichment pipes.
There are several pipes available to generate a company headquarters address via API. For this blog post, we're 
using the pipe [CompanyGetHQAddressGoogleMaps@1](https://www.pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog/company-get-hq-address-google-maps/version-1).

This pipe relies on fetching location data from Google Maps and summarizing this data with the help of an LLM.

The cost per invocation is ~1ct. per company headquarters address.

## Prerequisites

üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go to [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) and create an account <br />
üîë Create an API Key
