# Introducing pipe0: A data enrichment framework for the next generation of sales technology

Hello. I'm [Florian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-martens-86b224b4/) üåà. I've built what you 
currently see and will likely build most of what you will see on the [pipe0 website](https://pipe0.com).
I previously worked at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and did cool stuff with images and data.

Now I'm building sales software.

Wait, ~cross that~. pipe0 is not sales software. Pipe0 is software for companies that build sales software. Yeah, that sounds about right...

## What is data enrichment?

If you have some data about a person or company but want more, you use data enrichment. Let's say you have the 
name of a person but want the email address too.

Pipe0 lets you enrich data in an infinite number of ways while being easier to integrate, cheaper, and faster than comparable tools.

## The opportunity in front

Since [clay](https://clay.com) rose to popularity last year, many sales technology tools have struggled with changing user requirements. Users expect 
competing tools to provide the same data quality as clay.

Most sales technology tools don't and risk becoming point-based solutions - one clay upgrade away from being replaced.

On the other side of this coin lies a massive opportunity. Workflows based on clay are tedious at best. Today, many users
export data from "Tool A" into clay only to export the enriched data into "Tool C".

This is not what users want. A common complaint about clay is its complexity and the need for specialists to 
set it up.

## An uneven playing field

Building software that runs on enriched data is surprisingly difficult. It involves:

- üîå Connecting & monitoring existing data providers
- üêõ Building AI-enabled scraping infrastructure
- ü§ñ Giving users control over how to enrich data
- üí∞ Find cost-effective ways for all of the above

This is where [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) comes in. Pipe0 aims to solve data enrichment for sales technology companies 
so they can build features on enriched data extremely fast.

## We're building pipe0 to be radically simple

What makes pipe0 special is its data model called <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>. While tools 
like clay process enrichments on a cell-by-cell basis and require large APIs, we found a much simpler way to solve
the same problem faster and cheaper.

Our entire framework runs on one idea.

> Define pipelines, and run them.

Let's assume you want to render enriched data in a clay-like table.

Instead of having a large table with thousands of cells, you create a pipeline with many pipes.

If you want to run a single cell, you create a new pipeline, run it, and merge it into the bigger pipeline.

If you want to run the first 10 rows of that table, you create a new pipeline, run it, and merge it.

Our data model is so simple that we have an internal challenge to reimplement clay's core logic in less than 1k lines of code 
(including a full UI!).

What's more? Did I mention that you don't have to render your data as a table? In fact, you don't have to render your data at all.
Pipe0 is great at powering [tools without UI](https://pipe0.com/resources/documentation/other-apps), too.
