# How to find the docker compose file in coolify to read stack logs

In certain situations, it is helpful to have access to the `docker-compose.yaml` file in [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

This allows you to run [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) commands for any application stack in coolify.

In my case, I was looking to read application logs. I was trying to catch a log from a `SIGTERM` event and the logs 
were not showing up in the coolify dashboard because the container exited too fast.

I wanted to run the command:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['sh']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>docker compose logs</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Locating the `docker-compose` file

Coolify manages the docker compose files in a top-level directory:

`/data/coolify/applications/application_id`

In order to access it, switch into a root shell `sudo su` and navigate to `cd /data/coolify/applications/`.

Find the application id for your project and enter the folder with the corresponding `id`.

Within the folder, you will find the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
