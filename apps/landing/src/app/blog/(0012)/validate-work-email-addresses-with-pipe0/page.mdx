# Find a Work Email Address by Name and Company

In this blog post, we explore how you can validate work email addresses via an API endpoint.
For this, we use [pipe0](https://pipe0.com).

Pipe0 is a framework for data enrichment. To enrich data with pipe0 you use enrichment pipes.
There are several pipes available to validate work email addresses via API. For this blog post, we're 
using the pipe [PeopleIsWorkEmail@1](https://www.pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog/people-is-work-email-pipe0/version-1).

This pipe simply checks if a given email address is linked to a publically known free 
email provider and therefore not a valid work email address.

If you want to go even further you can use the [PeopleValidateEmailZeroBounce@1 pipe](https://www.pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog/people-validate-email-zerobounce/version-1).
This pipe uses [zerobounce](https://www.zerobounce.net/) to validate the existence of the email address to 
protect your reputation.

The pipe "PeopleIsWorkEmail@1" is free to use on pipe0 (if you have a subscription).

## Prerequisites

üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go to [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) and create an account <br />
üîë Create an API Key

## Request object

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript", "cURL"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const id = 1;
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer <API_KEY>`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [{ name: "PeopleIsWorkEmail@1" }],
    input: [{id, workEmail: "<EMAIL_ADDRESS>" }]
  })
});

const response = await result.json();

// [NOT SHOWN] Poll the "/check" endpoint until the task status is "completed"
// Learn more: https://www.pipe0.com/resources/documentation/pipeline#async-processing

// Print email
console.log(response.records[id].fields["isWorkEmail"].value);
```
    </div>
    <div>
```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-d '{
    "pipes": [{ "name": "PeopleIsWorkEmail@1" }],
    "input": [{ id: 1, workEmail: "<EMAIL_ADDRESS>" }]
}'
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

## Using pipe0

In this example we used [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) instead of querying providers directly. Using pipe0 
has many advantages:

- Use 50+ enrichment providers with one subscription
- Combine multiple enrichments in one API call
- Up-to-date API documentation and best-in-class DX
- Combine data enrichment, web scraping, and AI for powerful solutions
