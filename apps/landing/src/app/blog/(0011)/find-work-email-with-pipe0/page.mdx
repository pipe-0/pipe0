# Find a Work Email Address by Name and Company

In this blog post, we explore how you can generate a work email address via an API endpoint.
For this, we use [pipe0](https://pipe0.com).

Pipe0 is a framework for data enrichment. To enrich data with pipe0 you use enrichment pipes.
There are several pipes available to find a work email address via API. For this blog post, we're 
using the pipe [people:workemail:waterfall@1](https://www.pipe0.com/resources/pipe-catalog/people-get-work-email-waterfall/version-1).

This pipe relies on fetching contact data from multiple sources as a waterfall.

The cost per invocation is ~13ct. per work email address.

## Prerequisites

üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go to [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) and create an account <br />
üîë Create an API Key

## Request object

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript", "cURL"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const id = 1;
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer <API_KEY>`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [{ pipe_id: "people:workemail:waterfall@1", providers: ["findymail", "dropcontact"] }],
    input: [{id, first_name: "<FIRST_NAME>", last_name: "<LAST_NAME>", company_website_url: "<COMPANY_URL>"}]
  })
});

const response = await result.json();

// [NOT SHOWN] Poll the "/check" endpoint until the task status is "completed"
// Learn more: https://www.pipe0.com/resources/documentation/pipeline#async-processing

// Print email
console.log(response.records[id].fields["workEmail"].value);
```
    </div>
    <div>
```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "pipes": [{ "pipe_id": "people:workemail:waterfall@1",  providers: ["findymail", "dropcontact"] }],
    "input": [{"id": 1, "first_name": "<FIRST_NAME>", "last_name": "<LAST_NAME>", "company_website_url": "<COMPANY_URL>"}]
}'
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

## Advantages of using providers in a waterfall

We used a waterfall enrichment. Waterfall enrichments are great for 
retrieving email addresses via API. They are great since we don't fail for failed lookups. This way, 
we can try to get the email address from the first provider. If the provider is able to find the contact
information, we return it. If it does not, we go to the second provider.

## Using pipe0

In this example we used [pipe0](https://pipe0.com) instead of querying providers directly. Using pipe0 
has many advantages:

- Use 50+ enrichment providers with one subscription
- Combine multiple enrichments in one API call
- Up-to-date API documentation and best-in-class DX
- Combine data enrichment, web scraping, and AI for powerful solutions
