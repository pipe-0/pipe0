# Pipes

Pipes are processing blocks for data enrichment. Each of your input objects will be processed by every 
pipe of your pipeline. 

Example: The pipe `PeopleGetCompanyWebsiteUrl:Email@1` processes every input object
of a request. The pipe requires the input field `email` and produces an output field called `company_website_url`.

If the pipe cannot find its required inputs in the record, it will produce a field error.

```ts
cosnt obj = {
  name: "Will Smith",
  email: "will@hollywood.com"
  // company_website_url: "https://hollywood.com" < will be added
}
```

## Inputs and outputs

Each pipe takes one or more input fields and produces one or more output fields. Pipe input and
output fields can be cound in the <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog"> ðŸ““ pipe catalog</AppLink>.

To match the input requirements of a pipe you can provide the input fields via your input objects
or add a pipe to your pipeline that outputs the input field.

Desining pipelines in a way that all inputs and outputs line up is probably the hardest part of working 
with pipe0 (it's not that hard!).

## Pipe Configuration

When creating a <AppLink linkType="pipelineRequest">pipeline request</AppLink> you can pass additional configuration to pipes. The configuration
for a pipe can be found in the <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink>.

It is almost <AppLink linkType="flexPipe">always safe</AppLink> to assume that you can point the input and output fields of a pipe to an `alias`.

### Field Aliases

Input and output fields have default names. You can reassign fields to different names by passing 
a <AppLink linkType="pipe">config object</AppLink>.

```json filename="Rename input fields"
{
  "pipe_id": "PeopleGetCompanyWebsiteUrl:Email@1",
  "config": {
    "input_fields": {
      "email": {
        "alias": "special-email-name"
      }
    },
    "output_fields": {
      "company_website_url": {
        "alias": "spcial-website-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Flex pipes

As stated earlier, it is almost always safe to assume that you can point the input and output fields of pipes to aliases. 
The only pipes where this is not possible are pipes that run generic AI prompts. These pipes receive their input fields 
from a prompt and have user-defined flexible output fields.

Since the user of the pipe is already in control of the field names, there is no need to assign aliases.

Flex pipes follow a specific format to declare input and output fields. Here is an example:


```json
{
  "prompt": "Based on the name of the person {{ input name type=\"string\" required=\"true\" }} assign a character from the TV show \"The Simpsons\" to that person. {{ output value description=\"Name of a character from the TV show 'The Simpsons\'\" }}",
}
```

Within the text prompt you can specify any number of input or output fields.

**type**: "string" | "number" | "boolean" <br/>
**required**: "true" | "false" <br/>
**description**: string <br/>

### Pipe Names

Pipes are named in a consistent way so you can understand what a pipe does by reading its name.

Every pipe name follows the following format:

```
category[:action]:target:source[:input_type]@version
```

Hereâ€™s what each part means:

1. **category**: Defines the subject you want to enrich data for. This can be companies, people, websites, email addresses, etc.

2. **action (optional)**: If the pipe performs another action than getting a value, the action will be set. Actions are versbs and refer to what is done e.g. "validate" or "check".

3. **target**: Describes the data the pipe fetches or operates on like "email" or "phonenumber".

3. **source**: Defines who supplies the data to run this pipe. If the data is provided by a single provider 
it's usually their name (ex. [ZeroBounce](https://zerobounce.com)). If the pipe combines multiple providers this section refers to a broader method like `Waterfall`.

4. **input_type (optional)**: To avoid naming collisions for pipes with the same action and source but incompatible input groups we sometimes 
add a section to specify the main input for this pipe.

5. **version**: Pipes are regularly updated to fix bugs, improve quality, optimize cost, etc. If we introduce breaking changes the version number is increased
so you can update at your own pace.
