[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a framework for data enrichment. It replaces providers 
like Zoominfo, Prospeo, or Findymail with a more flexible API.

Aside form finding information like email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn profiles
(s. <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink> for a full list),
you can use Pipe0 to express conditions, actions, and combine data with AI.

We took a lot of inspiration from [Clay](https://clay.com). We moved many of its features 
into a stateless, fast, and cost-effective API.

It's easy to underestimate the engineering challenge of building a robust data enrichment platform in-house.
Here are some things that you never have to worry about when using Pipe0:

⚡️ Enriching data in parallel with speed and accuracy<br />
🛑 Dealing with different provider rate limits<br />
🧼 Sanitizing & healing input data<br />
🖥️ Monitoring dozends of 3rd-party API integrations<br />
🌊 Building custom waterfalls <br />
💵 Managing credit balances with different providers <br />
🏗️ Run enrichment, scraping and AI infrastructure at low cost<br />
🍝 Spahgetti code<br />
💾 Caching <br />

## Use cases

🤖 Building sales technology applications like automated outreach, SDR, etc. <br />
🪄 AI Agents that need a flexible data source <br />
🧙🏻 Updating CRM or ATS data <br />
🧬 Enriching large datasets <br />
