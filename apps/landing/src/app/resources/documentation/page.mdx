[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a framework for data enrichment. It replaces providers 
like Zoominfo, Prospeo, or Findymail with a more flexible API.

We're developing three endpoints that you can use for simple and complex data enrichment.

You can use our endpoints to find phone numbers and email addresses or add complex features similar to [n8n](https://n8n.io) (node-based automation)
or [clay](https://clay.com) (table-based automation) to your application without much hassle.

Our three endpoints are:

**Pipes:** A composable endpoint to enrich data & perform actions in 3rd party systems <br />
**Searches:** A composable endpoint to search for companies and leads using filters <br />
**Effects (coming soon):** A data transforamtion endpoint <br />

Aside from finding people, companies, email addresses, and phone numbers — 
s. <AppLink linkType="catalogs">catalogs</AppLink> for a full list) —
you can use Pipe0 to express conditions, perform actions, and generate insights with AI.

It's easy to underestimate the engineering challenge of building a robust data enrichment platform in-house.
Here are some things that you never have to worry about when using Pipe0:

⚡️ Enriching data in parallel with speed and accuracy<br />
🛑 Dealing with different provider rate limits<br />
🧼 Sanitizing & healing input data<br />
🖥️ Monitoring dozens of 3rd-party API integrations<br />
🌊 Building custom waterfalls <br />
💵 Managing credit balances with different providers <br />
🏗️ Run enrichment, scraping and AI infrastructure at low cost<br />
🍝 Spaghetti code<br />
💾 Caching <br />

## Use cases

🤖 Building sales technology applications like automated outreach, SDR, etc. <br />
🪄 AI Agents that need a flexible data source <br />
🧙🏻 Updating CRM or ATS data <br />
🧬 Enriching large datasets <br />
