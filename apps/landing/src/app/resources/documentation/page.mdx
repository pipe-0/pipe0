[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a framework for data enrichment. It replaces providers 
like Zoominfo, Prospeo, or Findymail with a more flexible API.

You can use Pipe0 to: <br />
🧭 Find lists of leads and companies (prospecting) <br />
📱 Find data like phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles, email addresses, and more (enrichment). <br />
🧮 Express conditions, perform actions and generate insights with AI. <br />

Pipe0 took inspiration from tools like [n8n](https://n8n.io)
(node-based automation) and [clay](https://clay.com) (table-based automation). You can use Pipe0 to add similar
experiences to your applications at a fair price.

It's easy to underestimate the engineering challenge of building a robust data enrichment platform yourself.
Here are some things you never have to worry about when using Pipe0:

⚡️ Enriching data in parallel with speed and accuracy<br />
📊 Building analytics and monitoring <br />
🛑 Dealing with different provider rate limits<br />
🧼 Sanitizing & healing input data<br />
🖥️ Managing dozens of 3rd-party integrations<br />
🌊 Building custom waterfall enrichments <br />
💵 Managing credit balances with different providers <br />
💾 Caching <br />

Let's look at the following sequence. It's a combination of **search**, **data enrichment**, **conditions**, and **actions**:

> Find 1k software engineers in San Francisco with more than 3 years of experience (**search**).
> Find each candidate's LinkedIn profile (**enrichment**).
> IF the candidate has experience with Python, find their personal email address (**condition**).
> IF the email was found, compose a sales email and send it (**action**).
> IF the email address was NOT found, send a LinkedIn contact request (**action**).

In Pipe0, this sequence can be expressed with two API calls (1 call to <AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">Searches</AppLink>, 
1 call to <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">Pipes</AppLink>).

More importantly, Pipe0 sequences scale to millions of records and can power production applications.
