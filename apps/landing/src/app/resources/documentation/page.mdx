[Pipe0](https://pipe0.com) is a framework for data enrichment. It replaces providers 
like Zoominfo, Prospeo, or Findymail with a more flexible API.

We're developing three endpoints that allow everyone to integrate features similar to [n8n](https://n8n.io) (node-based automation)
or [clay](https://clay.com) (table-based automation) into their applications at a fair price.

**Pipes:** A composable endpoint to enrich data & perform actions in 3rd party systems <br />
**Searches:**: A composable endpoint to search for companies and leads using filters <br />
**Comming soon:** A data transforamtion endpoint <br />

Our endpoints work great as a team. However, you can use each endpoint in isolation too.

Aside from finding people, companies, email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles
(s. <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink> & <AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">search catalog</AppLink> for a full list) and more,
you can use Pipe0 to express conditions, perform actions, and generate insights with AI.

It's easy to underestimate the engineering challenge of building a robust data enrichment platform in-house.
Here are some things that you never have to worry about when using Pipe0:

⚡️ Enriching data in parallel with speed and accuracy<br />
🛑 Dealing with different provider rate limits<br />
🧼 Sanitizing & healing input data<br />
🖥️ Monitoring dozens of 3rd-party API integrations<br />
🌊 Building custom waterfalls <br />
💵 Managing credit balances with different providers <br />
🏗️ Run enrichment, scraping and AI infrastructure at low cost<br />
🍝 Spaghetti code<br />
💾 Caching <br />

## Use cases

🤖 Building sales technology applications like automated outreach, SDR, etc. <br />
🪄 AI Agents that need a flexible data source <br />
🧙🏻 Updating CRM or ATS data <br />
🧬 Enriching large datasets <br />
