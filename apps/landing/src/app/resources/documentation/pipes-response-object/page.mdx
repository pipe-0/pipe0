# Response Object

The following API operations return a response of type `PipesResponse`.

- `POST https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run` (used to run the pipeline)
- `GET https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/check` (used to check the processing state)
- `POST https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run/sync` (used to run the pipeline synchronously)

At first, seeing the full response object can be intimidating. But our response object has been 
designed to make your life easy. Here are some things our responses are designed for:

üíÖ Building UIs inspired by tools like [Clay](https://clay.com) or [Airtable](https://airtable.com) <br />
üìÄ Enriching server-side to push to a CRM, ATS, or database <br />
üßôüèª Perform actions like lead scoring, CRM updates, or outreach without writing code

## Response object properties

### id

This is the task `id`. During and after processing you can use this id to look up 
your processing result. We store tasks for up to three days after processing is completed.

### status

The status of the response object.

#### Status 'pending'

Your request has been validated and an enrichment task has been created. Processing has not yet begun.

#### Status 'processing'

Your request has been validated and processing has begun. During processing, the status of your record 
fields is continuously updated.

#### Status 'completed'

Processing has finished without global errors. Individual fields still may have failed to process.

#### Status 'failed'

<AppLink linkType="pipelineValidation">Pipeline validation</AppLink> or processing has failed. See the global <AppLink linkType="globalErrors">`errors` property</AppLink> for more information on why 
the failure occurred.

### order

We transform the list of input data into an object called <AppLink linkType="records">`records`</AppLink>. The `records` object has keys
that match the `ids` of your input data. However, the order of your input data is not preserved in the `records` object.

To preserve the original order of your input data we create the `order` property. An ordered list of input data `ids`.

### field_definitions

Metadata for all fields that exist in your <AppLink linkType="pipeline">pipeline</AppLink>.

Think of each input object as the rows of a table. If input data are the rows, then `fields_definitions`
are the columns.

The `field_definitions` object contains all fields that 
exist in your pipeline. This includes pipe output fields and field derived from <AppLink linkType="inputObject">input objects</AppLink>.
`field_definitions` is an object. The keys contain field names and the values field properties.

### pipes

The list of pipes that you sent as part of your request along with the pipe configuration. The pipes
are reordered according to their valid processing order. If pipeline validation failed, pipes are returned in the 
original order.

### errors

Global task errors. If your response contains errors at the top level, your task failed. Use this 
error array to understand why your task failed. Aside from the top-level response, individual fields
can fail too. In that case, the field will contain a local error.

### records

Each input object is transformed into a `record` object during processing.

#### record.id

The `id` you provided in your input object

#### record.fields

If your original request contained an `input` array of the shape `[{id: 1, foo: "bar"}, {id: 2, "bar": "baz"}]`,
all output `records` will have the fields `id`, `foo`, and `bar`.

Notice, that the fields are normalized. All output records have the same fields. If an input object contains 
a property, it is added to all output records.

In addition to fields derived from input objects, the `record.fields` property contains pipe output fields too.

It is guaranteed `field_definitions` and `record.fields` have the same keys.

#### record.field.value

The value of the field. If the value was provided as part of your input data it is copied over. If the 
value was generated from an enrichment operation, it is added.

#### record.field.status

The status of the field. Possible values are `completed`, `failed`, `pending`, `queued`, `processing`, or `no_result`.
The `status` is `no_result` if processing is completed without yielding a meaningful 
result. The status is `failed` if the pipe failed due to errors.

#### record.field.type

The type of the provided or generated value. Possible values are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `json`, or `unkown`.
The type will be `unknown` if the field was derived from input data but no input object provided a value **and**
the field is not an output field of a pipe.

#### record.field.reason

Is guaranteed to exist if the field status is `failed` or `no_result`. Is of type `null | {code: string; summary: string; message: string}`.
Will contain additional information about pipe failure.


#### record.field.claimed_by

Each field is assigned to an entity that is responsible for `resolving` it. Resolvers can be input data or pipes.
A pipe will "claim" each field it is responsible for. However, just because a pipe claims a field does not mean it will
resolve it.
If your input object already contains a valid value, the field will be claimed by a pipe but resolved by `input`.

Use this field to render fields as columns ordered by pipe.

#### record.field.resolved_by

Is guaranteed to exist if the status of the field is `completed`. Is guaranteed to be `null` if the status is not 
`completed`. The `resolved_by` field informs if a field was processed by a pipe or copied over from input data.

#### record.field.meta

Contains `metadata` about the field processing. In the case of waterfall enrichments, you can find information about
all the providers that were tried in this field.

#### record.field.ui

Additional information for rendering the field value.
