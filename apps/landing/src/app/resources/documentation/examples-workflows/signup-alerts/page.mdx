# Signup Alert Example

This example illustrates a workflow designed to generate a Slack alert. The alert is triggered upon a 
new user signup and is conditional on the user meeting your predetermined ideal customer profile (ICP) criteria.

```typescript filename="signup-alert.ts"
zero.POST("/v1/pipes/run/sync", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer <API_KEY>`,
  },
  body: {
    config: {
      environment: "production",
    },
    pipes: [
      { pipe_id: "people:email:iswork@1" },
      {
        pipe_id: "company:websiteurl:email@1",
        trigger: {
          action: "run",
          when: {
            logic: "and",
            conditions: [
              {
                field_name: "is_work_email",
                operator: "eq",
                property: "value",
                value: true,
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
      {
        pipe_id: "company:overview@1",
      },
      {
        pipe_id: "prompt:run@1",
        config: {
          prompt: {
