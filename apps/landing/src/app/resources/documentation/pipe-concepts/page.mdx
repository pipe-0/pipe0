# Pipe Concepts

This page contains additonal information about pipes.

## Pipe types

### Single provider pipes

Many pipes use a single provider for processing. Providers can be a third-party services like 
[LeadMagic](https://leadmagic.io) or [ZeroBounce](https://zerobounce.com). Native pipes use Pipe0 as a provider.

### Waterfall pipes

Waterfall pipes use many providers in a cascading sequence. We try provider A. If the data is found, it is returned.
If the data is not found we try provider B. If the data is not found again, we try provider C and so on.

A billing event occurs for the provider that returns a result. Providers that return `no_result`
are not billed.

Waterfall enrichments can drastically increase data coverage. But keep in mind that trying many providers 
can slow down processing speed.

#### Choosing providers

Waterfall pipes have a `config.providers` option. The option is typically of the type `Array<{ provider: <PROVIDER_NAME> }>`.
If no config is provided the default config is applied. If you remove a provider from the array, this provider is removed
from your processing squence.

Providers are processed according to their position in the `config.providers` array. The provider with the index 0 is processed first.
You are encouraged to change the order.


## Field mode

The field mode determines the shape of the <AppLink linkType="pipeConfig">config object</AppLink> a pipe takes.

### Field mode: `static`

Most <AppLink linkType="pipe">pipes</AppLink> have static <AppLink linkType="inputField">input</AppLink> 
and <AppLink linkType="outputField">output fields</AppLink>. When `field_mode` is set to `static` the 
pipe's in- and outputs are known in advance.

You can point the input fields to different fields or rename the outputs but the pipe's API is clearly 
defined in advance.

_Example_: 

When using the pipe `people:workemail:waterfall@1`, we use the
input fields `name` and `company_website_url` to generate the output field `work_email`.

### Field mode: `prompt`

The user is required to specify the inputs and outputs of a pipe via a prompt.

_Example_:

The pipe `run:prompt@1` uses any number of input fields to generate any number of output fields. The
user may specify any input or output field by using <AppLink linkType="promptTags">prompt tags</AppLink>.

#### Prompt tags

To define fields in `prompt` mode, use the following syntax to define fields.


```json
{
  "prompt": "Based on the name of the person {{ input name type=\"string\" required=\"true\" }} assign a character from the TV show \"The Simpsons\" to that person. {{ output value description=\"Name of a character from the TV show 'The Simpsons\'\" }}",
}
```

**type**: "string" | "number" | "boolean" <br/>
**required**: "true" | "false" <br/>
**description**: string <br/>
