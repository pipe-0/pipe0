# Quickstart
<br />

Before making your first request, the following is required:

ðŸ‘¾ Create an account <br />
ðŸ”‘ Go to "settings" â†’ "api keys" and "create" a key <br />
ðŸ’³ Buy a subscription to make requests in production mode <br />

## Making requests

This request enriches one <AppLink linkType="inputObject">input object</AppLink>. The pipe `people:workemail:waterfall@1`
adds a field called `work_email` to your input objects.

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "cURL"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
},
body: JSON.stringify({
    pipes: [
    {
        pipe_id: "people:workemail:waterfall@1"
    },
    ],
    input: [
        {
            id: 1, // assign an id to each input object
            name: "John Doe",
            company_website_url: "https://pipe0.com"
        }
    ]
})
});
```
    </div>
    <div>
     ```python
import requests
import json

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
}
payload = {
    "pipes": [
        {
            "pipe_id": "people:workemail:waterfall@1"
        },
    ],
    "input": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "company_website_url": "https://pipe0.com"
        }
    ]
}
response = requests.post("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run", headers=headers, json=payload)
```
    </div>
    <div>
    ```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
-d '{
        "pipes": [
            {
            "pipe_id": "people:workemail:waterfall@1"
            },
        ],
        "input": [
            {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "company_website_url": "https://pipe0.com"
            }
        ]
    }'
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

The result will look something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "company_website_url": "https://pipe0.com",
        "work_email": "john@pipe0.com"
    }
]
```

You can also try to find information like phone numbers and company details within the same request. For this, you can 
chain multiple enrichment pipes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The response will contain more information than displayed here. Learn how to work with <AppLink linkType="pipelineResponse">response objects</AppLink>.

### Sync or Async

The request uses the `/v1/run/sync` endpoint. This endpoint returns enriched records within one roundtrip.
This only works for enriching a few records at a time.

To enrich more data, use the `/v1/run` endpoint and poll the `/v1/check` endpoint until your 
enrichment task is marked as `completed`.

### Sandbox

Running pipelines in `production` mode incurs usage costs. For testing, all pipes offer a 
<AppLink linkType="testMode">sandbox environment</AppLink>. **Making requests in the sandbox environment is always free.**

Do not expect sandbox data to make sense. Expect the data to be structurally 
correct in regards to type, content length, and format.

To send `sandbox` requests, set the header `x-environment` to `sandbox`. If the header is missing or set to any value
other than `sandbox` the request is considered to be in `production` mode.
