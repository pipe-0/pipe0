# Request Concepts

## Sandbox

All endpoints offer the ability to run in `sandbox mode`. Making requests in sandbox mode is free.

Sandbox data is structurally correct but fake.

To send `sandbox` requests, set `config.environment` to `sandbox`.

## Sync or Async

All endpoints offer the choice between enriching and searching synchonously or asynchonously.

- Synchonously: The endpoint returns a result within one roundtrip.
- Asynchonously: You send a request to create a task. You then poll the `/check` endpoint until the task is marked as `completed`.

Choosing between the two is up to you. All endpoints may timeout when used synchonously. Reasons for timeouts are often beyound 
our control (provider latency). We recommend to run all your production requests asynchonously and use the `/sync` endpoints for testing only. 

## Create an OpenAPI client

### OpenAPI 3.1

When creating request payloads it is helpful to have autocomplete in your IDE. For this, you can generate a client from 
our open API file hosted at:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['url']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>https://api.pipe0.com/openapi</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

API clients wrap the HTTP API with language-native function calls.

### Generator libraries

There are open-source tools that can generate clients in many languages:

#### TypeScript

[`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)

#### Python

[openapi-python-client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

#### Java / Kotlin

[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
