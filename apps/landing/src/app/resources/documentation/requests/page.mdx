# Request Concepts

### Sandbox

Running searches in `production` mode incurs usage costs. For testing, all pipes offer a 
sandbox environment. Making requests in the sandbox environment is free. Sandbox data is structurally correct but fake.

To send `sandbox` requests, set `config.environment` to `sandbox`.

### Sync or Async

The request uses the `/v1/run/sync` endpoint. This endpoint returns enriched records within one roundtrip.
This only works for enriching a few records at a time.

To enrich more data, use the `/v1/run` endpoint and poll the `/v1/check` endpoint until your 
enrichment task is marked as `completed`.

### Create an OpenAPI client

## OpenAPI 3.1

When creating request payloads it is helpful to have autocomplete in your IDE. For this, you can generate a client from 
our open API file hosted at:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['url']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>https://api.pipe0.com/openapi</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

API clients wrap the HTTP API with language-native function calls.

### Generator libraries

There are open-source tools that can generate clients in many languages:

#### TypeScript

[`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)

#### Python

[openapi-python-client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

#### Java / Kotlin
