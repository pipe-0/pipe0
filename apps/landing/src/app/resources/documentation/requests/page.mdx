# Request Concepts

## Sandbox

All endpoints offer the ability to run in `sandbox mode`. Making requests in sandbox mode is free.

Sandbox data is structurally correct but fake.

To send `sandbox` requests, set `config.environment` to `sandbox`.

## Sync or Async

All endpoints offer the choice between enriching and searching synchronously or asynchronously.

- Synchronously: The endpoint returns a result within one round-trip.
- Asynchronously: You send a request to create a task and poll the `/check` endpoint until the task is marked as `completed`.

Choosing between the two is up to you. All endpoints may timeout when used synchronously. Reasons for timeouts are often beyond 
our control (provider latency). We recommend running your production requests asynchronously. Synchronous requests are recommended for testing. 

## Create an OpenAPI client

### OpenAPI 3.1

When creating request payloads, it is helpful to have autocomplete in your IDE. For this, you can generate a client from 
our OpenAPI file hosted at:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['url']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>https://api.pipe0.com/openapi</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

API clients wrap the HTTP API with language-native function calls.

### Generator libraries

There are open-source tools that can generate clients in many languages:

#### TypeScript

[`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)

#### Python

[openapi-python-client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

#### Java / Kotlin
