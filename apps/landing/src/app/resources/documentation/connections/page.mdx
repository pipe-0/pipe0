# Connections

Connections determine how your request authenticates with external services. Connections often 
point to credentials used during a request (ex., an API key).

## Managed connections

When making <AppLink linkType="authentication">authenticated requests</AppLink>, you're using managed connections by default. You can make 
requests to providers like Leadmagic, Zerobounce, or Clado without having to buy additional subscriptions. Everything is managed 
through pipe0.

Using pipe0 this way is faster, safer, and less error-prone than using your credentials.

Here are a few reasons why we recommend using managed connections when possible.

- üòµ‚Äçüí´ We don't know what rate limits to use with your credentials (conservative defaults)
- üí∂ You have to manage your own credit balances with 3rd party providers
- üê∏ You don't have to share sensitive credentials with us

Some pipes and searches require you to bring connections - like the [actions:sendmail:resend@1](/resources/pipe-catalog/action:sendmail:resend/1) pipe.
This pipe requies you to bring your own API key. You can do so by storing your API key with us and referencing it in your request.

## Custom connections

Custom connections are API keys/credentials that you own. To use custom connections, share 
your credentials with pipe0.

We plan to offer different ways in which you can share your API keys with us securely
but as of today the only available option is [vault](#vault).

### Custom connection billing

We charge a small platform fee for running pipes & searches via custom connections. This is to prevent abuse.

**0.05 credits** per successful pipe execution <br />
**0.08 credits** per successful search (no matter the # of search results)

### Vault

Vault is pipe0's secure storage layer. It is the only supported access mechanism for connections at this point.

#### Add connections to vault

To add your own connections:

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to settings/connections
3. Select the provider
4. Add your key
5. Copy the connection ID (ex., "resend_abcd123")
6. Use the ID in your requests

#### Reference vault connections

```bash filename="Request with custom connection"
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pipes": [
      {
        "pipe_id": "email:send:resend@1",
        "connector": {
          "strategy": "first",
          "connections": [
            {
              "type": "vault",
              "connection": "resend_abcd123"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "input": [{
        "id": "1",
        "email_subject": "Test email",
        "email_markdown": "Test email content.",
        "email": "receiver@pipe0.com",
    }]
  }'
```

The connector object can be used in the same manner for Searches requests.

#### Connectors and waterfalls

When pipes use multiple providers, you may want to provide a custom connection for just one provider.

Custom connections can safely target a subset of the available providers. Pipes will correctly use custom connections 
when present, and fall back to managed connections otherwise.

### The connector object

The connector object defines what credentials a pipe should use. It has the following shape:

```json
"connector": {
    "strategy": "first",
    "connections": [
        {
            "type": "vault",
            "connection": "resend_abcd123"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### connector.strategy

A strategy that is applied when multiple connections target the same provider. Currently, the only supported option is `first`.

**strategy.first**: Use the first referenced connection found in vault.

#### connector.connections

A list of referenced connections. Your request will return an error if you reference non-existent connections.

#### connections.type

The access mechanism of your connection. 

**type.vault**: Uses pipe0's vault for storage.

#### connections.connection

The connection ID as found in the connections section of the pipe0 dashboard.
