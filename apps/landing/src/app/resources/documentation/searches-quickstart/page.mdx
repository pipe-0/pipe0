# Quickstart

`Searches` is our <AppLink linkType="primitives">primitive</AppLink> (endpoint) for finding companies and people.
If you already have a list of people or companies that you want to enrich, skip to <AppLink linkType="pipesQuickstart">pipes</AppLink>.

## Prerequisites

The following is required:

ðŸ‘¾ Create an account <br />
ðŸ”‘ Go to "settings" â†’ "api keys" and "create" a key <br />
ðŸ’³ Buy a subscription to make requests in production mode <br />

## Making requests

Building lists of companies and people is a major pain point. Many providers claim to have the best dataset. Most 
companies purchase access to multiple datasets that need to be deduplicated and/or combined.

With searches, we give you access to multiple datasets via a single API. You can find the list of available datasets 
in the <AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">Search Catalog</AppLink>.

Let's start with a simple request to fetch company data using the [Icypeas](https://icypeas.com) dataset.

<CodeTabs items={["Typescript"]}>
    <div>
```typescript
const result = await fetch("https://api.pipe0.com/v1/searches/run", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        config: {
            environment: "production",
            dedup: {
                strategy: "default"
            }
        },
        searches: [
            {
                search_id: "people:profiles:icypeas@1",
                config: {
                    limit: 100,
                    filters: {
                        industry: {
                            include: ["Software Development"]
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
        ],
    })
});
```
    </div>
</CodeTabs>

Passing a top-level `config` object is optional. The default environemnt is `production` and the default deduplication strategy is `default`.

`searches` is an array. You can pass as many searches as you want. We will query every dataset you specify and return the results to you. Of course,
not all searches will return the same fields. A company search may return an object that contains `company_profile_url` where as a search
for people may return fields like `personal_email`.

We will return the fields in a normalized way setting misssing fields to `null`. You can pipe the output of a search 
straight into the input array of a `Pipes` request. Under the hood this uses <AppLink linkType="inputExpansion">input expansion</AppLink>.

The result will look something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "company_website_url": "https://pipe0.com",
        "work_email": "john@pipe0.com"
    }
]
```

> The response will contain more information than displayed here. Learn how to work with <AppLink linkType="pipelineResponse">response objects</AppLink>.

### Sandbox

Running pipelines in `production` mode incurs usage costs. For testing, all pipes offer a 
<AppLink linkType="testMode">sandbox environment</AppLink>. **Making requests in the sandbox environment is always free.**

Do not expect sandbox data to make sense. Expect the data to be structurally 
correct in regards to type, content length, and format.

To send `sandbox` requests, set the header `x-environment` to `sandbox`. If the header is missing or set to any value
other than `sandbox` the request is considered to be in `production` mode.
