# Response Object

The following API operations all return the same response.

- `POST https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run` (used to run the pipeline)
- `GET https://api.pipe0.com/v1/check` (used to check the processing state)
- `POST https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run/sync` (used to run the pipeline synchonously)

At first, seeing the full response object can be intimidating. But our response object has been 
designed to make your life easy. Here are some things our responses are designed for:

üíÖ Building UIs inspired by tools like [Clay](https://clay.com) or [Airtable](https://airtable.com) <br />
üìÄ Enriching server-side to push to a CRM, ATS, or database <br />
üßôüèª Perform actions like lead scoring, CRM updates, or outreach without writing code

## Response object properties

### id

This is the task `id`. During and after processing you can use this id to look up 
your processing result. We store tasks for up to three days after processing completed.

### status

The status of the response object.

#### Status 'pending'

Your request has been validated and an enrichment task has been created. Processing has not yet begun.

#### Status 'processing'

Your request has been validated and processing has begun. During processing that status of your record 
fields will be continuously updated.

#### Status 'completed'

Processing has finished without global errors. Individual fields still may have failed to process. No 
global error occured.

#### Status 'failed'

Validation or processing has failed. See the global `errors` property for more information on why the failure occured.

### order

We transform the list of input data into an object called `records`. The `records` object has keys
that match the `ids` of your input data. However, the order is not preserved. To preserve the order 
of input data from your original request, we create an ordered list of input data `ids`.

### field_definitions

The input data you provide with your request can be thought of as the rows of a table. If the data 
are the rows, the `fields` are the columns. The `field_definitions` object contains all fields that 
exist in your pipeline. These are the output fields of pipes as well as the initial fields created 
from your input data. The key represents the `field_name` and the `value` represent the field properties.

### pipes

The list of pipes that you sent as part of your request along with the pipe configuration. The pipes
are reordered according to the processing order.

### errors

Global task errors. If your response contains errors at the top-level, your task failed. Use this 
error array to understand why your task failed. Aside from the top-level response, individual fields
can fail too. In that case the field will contain a local error.

### records

Each input object is transformed into a `record` object during processing.

#### record.id

The `id` you provided in your input object

#### record.fields

If your original request contained an `input` array of the shape `[{id: 1, foo: "bar"}, {id: 2, "bar": "baz"}]`,
all `records` will have the fields `id`, `foo`, and `bar`. Notice, that the fields are normalized accross all your
`records`. In addition, to fields from `input objects` the fields object has keys for every pipe output field within 
your pipeline. It is guaranteed `field_definitions` and `fields` have the same keys.

#### record.field.value

The value of the field. If the value was provided as part of your input data it is simply copied over. If the 
value was generated from an enrichment operation, it is added.

#### record.field.status

The status of the field. Can be `completed`, `failed`, `pending`, `queued`, `processing`, or `no_result`.
The value will be `no_result` if the enrichment completed without any errors but did not find a meaningful 
result. In contrast, if the status is `failed` the enrichment failed due to an error.

#### record.field.type

The type of the provided or generated value. Can be `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `json`, or `unkown`.
The type will be `unknown` if the field was derived from your input data. If all input objects containing 
the property has a value of 'null' and no pipe outputs the field, we're not able to infer the type and set it to `unknown`.

#### record.field.reason

Is guaranteed to exist if the field status is `failed`. Is of the type `null | {code: string; summary: string; message: string}`.
Will contain additional information to explain the status/failure of a field.


#### record.field.claimed_by

Each field is assined to an entity that is responsible for `resolving` it. This can be your input data or a pipe.
In cases where some of your input data contain fields that can be generated by pipes the two overlap. A pipe will 
`claim` each field it is responsible for. But just because it's claimed a field does not mean it will resolve it.
If your input object already contains a valid value, the field will be claimed by a pipe but resolved by `input`.

This distinction makes it possible to render the columns ordered by pipes.

#### record.field.resolved_by

Is guranteed to exist if the status of the field is `completed`. is guranteed to be `null` if the status is not 
`completed`. This field will tell you if it was processed by a pipe or simply copied over from your input data.

#### record.field.meta

Contains `metadata` about the field processing. In case of waterfall enrichments you can find information about
all the providers that were tried in this field.

#### record.field.ui

Additional information for rendering the field value.
