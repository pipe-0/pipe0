## Making Authenticated Requests

All requests to pipe0 require authentication. The following is required:

ðŸ‘¾ Create an account <br />
ðŸ’³ Buy a subscription to make requests in production mode <br />

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Don't store API keys in the browser. Connect your browser-based app to pipe0 by 
> proxying requests through a secure server or serverless function that can 
> [store API keys securely](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys-best-practices).

### Create an API Key

API keys can be created through the dashboard.

### Making authenticated requests

To make authenticated requests, send your API key as part of the 
[`Authorization` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#the_general_http_authentication_framework).

```bash filename="Authenticated request"
curl -X POST "https://api.pipe0.com/v1/pipes/run" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
```
