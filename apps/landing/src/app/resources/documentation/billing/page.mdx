# Billing

Our billing system consists of:

- ðŸ¥ž Credits
- ðŸ’³ Subscriptions

## Credits

Enrichment requests in `production` mode are billed. The billing is on a per-record-basis.

If tasks fails, processed records until the point of failure are billed.

Enrichment requests in `sandbox` mode are always free.

You can find the cost per record for each pipe in the <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink>.

### Insufficient balance

If you're credit balance is insufficient to complete an ongoing enrichment task, the entire task fails and you will be billed
for the enrichment until failure.

### One-off purchases

You can purchase additional credits at your current subscription price. One-off credits can be purchased by
users with active subscriptions.

To purchase one-off credits contact [support@pipe0.com](mailto:support@pipe0.com).

### Credit rollover

For your convenience, it's possible to **hold up to 4x the credit amount** of either your monthly or yearly 
subscription value in your account. Credits balances that exceed this threshold are lost.

During subscription downgrades the credit rollover amount is lowered and the limit of your new subscription applies.

### Negative balances

We do not offer negative balances (line of credit) at this point.

If you're building a system that requies auto-top-ups to remain operational at all times contact [support@pipe0.com](mailto:support@pipe0.com).

### Pipe billing

Pipes are billed when they "run" in accordance with their <AppLink linkType="billingMode">billing mode</AppLink>.

Pipes "run" when at **least one** of their output fields will be generated. In case all output fields are provided 
by your input data, the pipe does not "run" unless **at least one** provided output value requires regeneration. See 
<AppLink linkType="inputSanitation">input sanitation</AppLink> for more info.

#### Billing mode

A property of a pipe is its `billing_mode`.

#### billing_mode `always`

Pipes with `billing_mode='always'` are billed on every run. Credits are deducted from your balance regardless of 
the pipe's result. Even if pipe output fields are marked as `no_result`, credits will be deducted
from your balance. See <AppLink linkType="fieldStatus">field staus</AppLink> for more info.

Pipe are not be billed if the pipe run fails (error state).

#### billing_mode `on_success`

Pipes with `billing_mode=on_success` are billed when at least one of their output fields was marked 
as `completed`. This indicates a successful result. If all output fields of a pipe are marked as `no_result`, the pipe is not billed.
See <AppLink linkType="fieldStatus">field staus</AppLink> for more info.
