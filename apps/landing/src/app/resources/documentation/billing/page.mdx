# Billing

Our billing system consists of:

- ðŸ’² Credits
- ðŸ’³ Subscriptions

## Credits

Credits are the universal currency of pipe0. Requests in `production` mode are billed in credits.
You are never billed if an operation returns an error.

You can make request to third-party services without purchasing subscriptions to these services using credits.

You can find the credit costs per operation in the <AppLink linkType="pipeCatalog">pipe catalog</AppLink> and/or 
<AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">search catalog</AppLink>.


## Pipe billing

Pipes are billed when they "run".

Pipes "run" when at **least one** of their output fields will be generated. In case all output fields are provided 
by your input data, the pipe does not "run" unless **at least one** provided output value requires regeneration. See 
<AppLink linkType="inputSanitation">input sanitation</AppLink> for more info.

Pipes can "run" without consuming credits. This is determined by their <AppLink linkType="billingMode">billing mode</AppLink>.

### Billing mode

A property of a pipe is its `billing_mode`.

### billing_mode `always`

Pipes with `billing_mode='always'` are billed on every run. Credits are deducted from your balance regardless of 
the pipe's result. Even if pipe output fields are marked as `no_result`, credits will be deducted
from your balance. See <AppLink linkType="fieldStatus">field status</AppLink> for more info.

Pipes are not billed if the pipe run fails (error state).

### billing_mode `on_success`

Pipes with `billing_mode=on_success` are billed when at least one of their output fields is marked 
as `completed`. This indicates a successful result. If all output fields of a pipe are marked as `no_result`, the pipe is not billed.
See <AppLink linkType="fieldStatus">field status</AppLink> for more info.

## Search billing

Searches are billed per successful result or per search.

### billing_mode `per_result` 

You are billed per search result. If a search request returned 500 entries you are billed 500 times 
the `cost per result`.

The cost per result can be found in the <AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">search catalog</AppLink>.

### billing_mode `per_search` 

You are billed per search. If a search request returned 500 entries you are billed only once.

The cost per search can be found in the <AppLink linkType="searchCatalog">search catalog</AppLink>.

## Insufficient balance

If your credit balance is insufficient to complete an ongoing enrichment task, the entire task fails and you will be billed
for the enrichment until failure.

## One-off purchases

You can purchase additional credits at your current subscription price. One-off credits can be purchased by
users with active subscriptions.

To purchase one-off credits contact [support@pipe0.com](mailto:support@pipe0.com).

## Credit rollover

For your convenience, you can **hold up to 4x the credit amount** of either your monthly or yearly 
subscription value in your account. Credit balances that exceed this threshold are lost.

During subscription downgrades the credit rollover amount is lowered and the limit of your new subscription applies.

### Negative balances

We do not offer negative balances (line of credit).

If you're building a system that requires auto-top-ups to remain operational at all times contact [support@pipe0.com](mailto:support@pipe0.com).

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are managed through [Stripe](https://stripe.com). 
This ensures a reliable and secure environment for your billing information.

You can create, update, and cancel your subscription at any time.
Navigate to "Dashboard" > "Billing" > "Manage Subscriptions"
to access the billing portal.
