## Introduction

> pipe0 pipe0 is a unified enrichment API for people and company data. You can leanr more about pipe0 by [visiting our landing page](/)

With pipe0 it becomes easy to add any kind of enrichment flows into your application. Weather you're planning to enrich just a couple of records 
or millions, pipe0 is designed for you.

Out goal is to build an API that is infinitely powerful but can be understood and implemented in just a couple of minutes. Check out our example of [building Clay.com](https://google.com) in less than 1k lines of code.

Our API has only two endpoints: `/v1/run` (create a task to enrich data) and `/v1/check`. Check the status of your enrichment task.

Enriching data works by fist defining a pipeline and adding `pipes` to said pipeline.

### Pipe Naming Convention

Our data enrichment catalog uses a consistent naming schema to make it easy to understand what each enrichment does, how it works, and how it’s versioned. Every enrichment name follows this format:

**[Category]-[Action][Target]-[Variant]-[Provider]-[Version]**

Here’s what each part means:

#### Components
1. **Category**  
   - **What it is**: The broad group or scope this enrichment applies to.
   - **Examples**: `People` (individual-related), `Company` (business-related).
   - **Purpose**: Helps you quickly filter enrichments by their domain.

2. **Action[Target]**  
   - **What it is**: A fused term combining the *action* (what the enrichment does) and the *target* (what it works on or produces).
   - **Actions**: Examples include `Get` (retrieve), `Check` (evaluate), `Split` (transform), `Validate` (verify).
   - **Targets**: Examples include `BusinessEmail`, `WorkEmail`, `Name`, `Revenue`.
   - **Examples**: `GetBusinessEmail` (retrieve an email), `CheckWorkEmail` (assess if it’s a work email), `SplitName` (divide a name into parts).
   - **Purpose**: Clearly states the enrichment’s goal in a compact way.

3. **Variant**  
   - **What it is**: The specific method, input source, or approach used to perform the action.
   - **Examples**: `LinkedIn` (uses a LinkedIn URL), `NameDomain` (uses name + domain), `Logic` (rule-based check), `Standard` (basic method).
   - **Purpose**: Distinguishes between enrichments that achieve the same result in different ways.

4. **Provider**  
   - **What it is**: The tool, service, or approach powering the enrichment.
   - **Examples**: `Waterfall` (multi-source strategy), `ZeroBounce` (specific provider), `Internal` (custom-built).
   - **Purpose**: Identifies who or what delivers the enrichment.

5. **Version**  
   - **What it is**: The version number of the enrichment, showing updates or iterations.
   - **Format**: Simple numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `2.1`).
   - **Purpose**: Tracks improvements or changes over time.

#### How It Works
- **Delimiters**: Hyphens (`-`) separate each component for easy reading and parsing.
- **Case**: Multi-word terms use CamelCase (e.g., `BusinessEmail`, `NameDomain`) for clarity; single words stay as-is (e.g., `People`).

#### Examples
| Name                                   | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `People-GetBusinessEmail-LinkedIn-Waterfall-1` | Retrieve a business email for a person using LinkedIn, via Waterfall, v1. |
| `People-CheckWorkEmail-Logic-Internal-1`       | Check if an email is work-related using logic, built internally, v1.     |
| `People-SplitName-Standard-Internal-1`         | Split a person’s name into first/last using a standard method, v1.       |
| `People-ValidateEmail-ZeroBounce-ZeroBounce-1` | Validate an email using ZeroBounce’s method and service, v1.            |
| `Company-PredictRevenue-Model-Internal-2.1`   | Predict company revenue with a model, built internally, v2.1.           |

#### Why This Format?
- **Clarity**: Instantly see what an enrichment does and how it does it.
- **Flexibility**: Supports retrieval, validation, logical checks, transformations, and more.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new categories, actions, or variants as the catalog grows.
- **Organization**: Group by category (e.g., all `People-*`) or provider (e.g., all `*-Waterfall-*`).

This naming convention ensures our enrichment catalog is intuitive, consistent, and powerful—making it simple for you to find and use the right tool for your data needs.
