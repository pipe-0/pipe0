## Introduction

> pipe0 pipe0 is a unified enrichment API for people and company data. You can leanr more about pipe0 by [visiting our landing page](/)

With pipe0 it becomes easy to add any kind of enrichment flows into your application. Weather you're planning to enrich just a couple of records 
or millions, pipe0 is designed for you.

Out goal is to build an API that is infinitely powerful but can be understood and implemented in just a couple of minutes. Check out our example of [building Clay.com](https://google.com) in less than 1k lines of code.

Our API has only two endpoints: `/v1/run` (create a task to enrich data) and `/v1/check`. Check the status of your enrichment task.

Enriching data works by fist defining a pipeline and adding `pipes` to said pipeline.
