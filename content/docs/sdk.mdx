## Typescript

Pipe0 offers a client side SDK written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The SDK makes working with the API easier. The SDK can help you:

- Discover field names with strong typing (Typescript)
- Validate [pipeline requests](/docs/pipeline) before sending them to the server
- Send pipeline requests to your server

The SDK is intended for use in browsers but you can make use of it in any Javascript runtime too.
