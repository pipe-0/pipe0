## Introduction

Pipe0 is built arond the idea of unifying various enrichment providers in a unified API. While this is infinitely powerful,
it can lead to test requests incurring costs.

Pipe0 ships with a built-in "Test Mode" for every pipe.

## Test mode

Test mode can be used in [pipeline requests](/docs/pipeline#pipeline-request). To send a test request 
add the `X-Test-Mode` header with a value of `true` to your requests.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.pipe0.com/v1/run' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
-H "X-Test-Mode: true" \
--data-raw '{
	"input": [],
	"pipes": []
}'
```
