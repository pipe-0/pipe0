It provides a minimal UI to submit requests, view the request body, processed values, and raw response.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
1. Install dependencies with npm install.
1. Run the app with npm start.
1. Click the "Enrich Data" button to send a test request.
1. Explore the results and customize requests via the Pipe0 Docs.

Note: Update the API key and URL in fetcher.ts to use real data.
